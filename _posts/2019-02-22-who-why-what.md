Hi,

We were "The Object Factory". We initially formed this group for our CS319 Object Oriented Programming course project Tetromax. We were so satisfied, we decided to continue with out group during CS491/2 Senior Design Project and renamed our group to "The Senior Factory". We're ready for another great project and another great year!
